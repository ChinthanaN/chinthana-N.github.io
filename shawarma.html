    <p><i>shawarma, popular street food in the Middle East, which originated in Turkey and is made of spit-roasted layers of lamb, beef, or other meat that are sliced and often wrapped in or served with pita. Shawarma is similar to Greek gyros, though the former is seasoned with more spices and the latter with more herbs.</i></p>
