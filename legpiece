       <p><i>A chicken leg extends from the claw to what would be the animal's hip. When carving a chicken, it is cut into two leg quarters and two breast quarters. Each leg quarter, or simply the leg, includes two parts: the drumstick and the thigh. The two pieces may remain attached or sold as separate cuts.</i></p>
